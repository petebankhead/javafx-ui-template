# JavaFX UI project

This repo contains a minimal Gradle project to help with creating a JavaFX project.

## What's this for?

This is used when creating new controls in QuPath... which don't necessarily have to depend upon QuPath.

The tricky bit is setting up the IDE with Gradle, other core dependencies, JavaFX etc.

Which is where this repo comes in.

## How do I use it?

The IDE I've used more for writing QuPath scripts is [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
Therefore the instructions focus on that - but potentially the approach could be used for other IDEs.

You can download the contents of this repo, copy them to wherever they need to go, and edit until you have a starting point for whatever you want to do next.

## License

There's nothing special here: it's just a template repo for convenience.

Use it as you wish (without warranty, of course).

If it had a license, it would be the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org).
I didn't include the unlicense file though, since if anyone forks the repo then they might forget to remove it - and inadvertently unlicense their own scripts.
